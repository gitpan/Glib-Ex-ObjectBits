This is some helpers for working with Glib::Objects.

* Glib::Ex::FreezeNotify holds a freeze_notify on one or more objects,
  for use in "scope guard" style.

* Glib::Ex::SignalIds holds a set of signal IDs and disconnects them
  when destroyed.

* Glib::Ex::SourceIds holds a set of main loop source IDs and
  disconnects them when destroyed.

* Glib::Ex::TieProperties ties the properties of an object to a Perl
  hash.

The common theme in FreezeNotify, SignalIds and SourceIds is that it
can be a good deal easier to manage the lifespan of a helper object
than to catch all the places your code jumps out or might drop its IDs
etc.

The only prerequisite is Glib-Perl, but of course Glib::Object does
very little by itself so in practice you'll be using this code with
Gtk2-Perl etc.  The ObjectBits home page is
