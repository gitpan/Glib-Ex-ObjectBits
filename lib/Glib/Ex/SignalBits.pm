=head1 NAME

Glib::Ex::SignalBits -- miscellaneous Glib signal helpers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Glib::Ex::SignalBits;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Accumulators

The following functions are designed for use as the "accumulator" in a
signal created by C<Glib::Object::Subclass> or
C<< Glib::Type->register_object >>.  The functions are trivial, but giving
them names gets the right sense and order for the return values.

=over 4

=item C<< ($cont, $ret) = Glib::Ex::SignalBits::accumulator_first ($hint, $acc, $ret) >>

Stop at and return the value from the first handler.

=item C<< ($cont, $ret) = Glib::Ex::SignalBits::accumulator_first_defined ($hint, $acc, $ret) >>

Stop at and return the first C<defined> value, in the Perl sense.  This
means the first non-NULL C<Glib::Object>, C<Glib::String>, etc, or first
non-C<undef> C<Glib::Scalar>.

=back

=head3 Example

    use Glib::Object::Subclass
      'Gtk2::Widget',
      signals => {
        'make-title' => {
          param_types   => ['Glib::Int'],
          return_type   => 'Glib::String',
          flags         => ['run-last'],
          class_closure => \&my_default_make_title,
          accumulator   => \&Glib::Ex::SignalBits::accumulator_first_defined,
        },
      };

Don't forget to C<use Glib::Ex::SignalBits> because a non-existent function
in a signal accumulator will cause an C<abort> from Perl-Glib (as of version
1.220).

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default, but each function can be requested in usual
C<Exporter> style,

    use Glib::Ex::SignalBits 'accumulator_first';
    
    use Glib::Object::Subclass
      ... accumulator => \&accumulator_first
