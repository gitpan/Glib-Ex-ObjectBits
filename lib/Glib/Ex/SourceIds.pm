=head1 NAME

Glib::Ex::SourceIds -- hold Glib main loop source IDs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Glib::Ex::SourceIds;
 my $sourceids = Glib::Ex::SourceIds->new
                    (Glib::Timeout->add (1000, \&do_timer),
                     Glib::Idle->add (\&do_idle));

 # removed when ids object destroyed
 $sourceids = undef;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Glib::Ex::SourceIds> holds a set of Glib main loop source IDs.  When the
SourceIds object is destroyed it removes those IDs.

This is designed to make life easier when keeping sources installed for a
limited period, such as an IO watch while communicating on a socket, or a
timeout on an action.  Often such things will be associated with a
C<Glib::Object> (or just a Perl object), though they don't have to be.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $sourceids = Glib::Ex::SourceIds->new ($id,$id,...) >>

Create and return a SourceIds object holding the given C<$id> main loop
source IDs (integers).

SourceIds doesn't install sources.  You do that with
C<< Glib::Timeout->add >>, C<< Glib::IO->add_watch >> and
C<< Glib::Idle->add >> in the usual ways and all the various options, then
pass the resulting ID to SourceIds to look after.  Eg.

    my $sourceids = Glib::Ex::SourceIds->new
                      (Glib::Timeout->add (1000, \&do_timer));

You can hold any number of IDs in a SourceIds object.  Generally if you want
things installed and removed at different points in the program then you'll
use separate SourceIds objects for each (or each group).

=item C<< $sourceids->add ($id,$id,...) >>

Add the given C<$id> main loop source IDs (integers) to SourceIds object
C<$sourceids>.  This can be used for IDs created separately from a C<new>
call.

    $sourceids->add (Glib::Timeout->add (1000, \&do_timer));

Adding IDs one by one is good if the code might error out.  IDs previously
connected are safely tucked away in the SourceIds and will be disconnect as
the error unwinds.  An error in a simple connection is unlikely, but if for
instance the "condition" flags for an C<add_watch> came from some external
code then they could be invalid.

=item C<< $sourceids->remove() >>

Remove the source IDs held in C<$sourceids> from the main loop, using
C<< Glib::Source->remove >>, if not already removed (for instance by a
"false" return from the handler code).  This remove is done when
C<$sourceids> is garbage collected, but you can do it explicitly sooner if
desired.
